        <p>Seven-year old Puja loves going to school in Jaipur. She is always among the top students in class. But ever
            since Puja lost her parents, paying for tuition and books has become a serious problem. Left with few other
            problems, the young girl wrote to Education for All seeking support. She received a scholarship which has
            allowed her to stay in school.</p>

        <p>Rajia is the daughter of a driver in Kolkata. She has always been a good student and managed to stay in
            school despite her family’s meager monthly income. When she cleared the West Bengal Joint Entrance
            Examinations, her future was made. But university education comes at a price. She was awarded a small one
            time grant from the West Bengal Government and also received support from Education for All and was able to
            continue her Computer science and Technology course.</p>

        <p>Over 15000 students have benefitted from Education For All in various forms as on date.
            The Education for All Project prioritizes need above merit, with the belief that any child who wants to
            continue going to school has the right to do so.</p>

        <p>The Trust belief that problems plaguing the nation such as unemployment, crime, corruption and population
            explosion have all been created by the lack of basic education. Creating opportunities for children to be
            educated will help minimize, if not eradicate, such issues. The Trust does not discriminate on the basis of
            caste, creed, religion or gender.</p>

        <p>EFA was launched by the former president of India, Pratibha Patil on July 23, 2006 at Governor House in
            Rajasthan in the presence of eminent educationalist Late Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan, Director of the United
            Nations Information Centre (India and Bhutan) Shalini Deewan, Shree Cements Managing Director H.M. Bangur
            and writer Taslima Nasreen.</p>

        <p>In its early days, the Trust also provided support to schools with funds to enhance their teaching staff
            strength. However, now the Trust concentrates on the sponsorship scheme, which has been found to produce
            greater results.</p>

        <p>The Trust also provide educational materials in terms of books, stationaries etc, to the underprivileged
            students in the Slum areas. During the lockdown, EFA have also partnered with various local NGOs in
            imparting quality skills in Children by organising various workshops, events and interactive sessions which
            were conducted by experts in their own field. </p>
